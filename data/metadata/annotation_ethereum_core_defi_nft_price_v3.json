    "ethereum.core.dim_contract_abis": "This table contains the contract ABIs that we have sourced from Etherscan, the community, or bytecode matched. This table is the source of ABIs used in the core__ez_decoded_event_logs and core__fact_decoded_event_logs tables. We first try to source ABIs from Etherscan. If we cannot find an ABI on Etherscan, we will rely on user submissions. If we are unable to locate an ABI for a contract from Etherscan or the community, we will try to find an ABI to use by matching the contract bytecode to a known contract bytecode we do have an ABI for.",
    "ethereum.core.dim_contracts": "This table contains all the contracts that are deployed on the Ethereum blockchain along with their on-chain metadata.",
    "ethereum.core.dim_dates": "This table contains the date and their respective information such as day of month, week, year, and week of year etc.",
    "ethereum.core.dim_event_signatures": "This table contains event signatures used to decode Ethereum event data into a human-readable format.",
    "ethereum.core.dim_function_signatures": "This table contains function signatures used to decode Ethereum call data into a human-readable format.",
    "ethereum.core.dim_labels": "The labels table is a store of one-to-one address identifiers, or an address name. Labels are broken out into a 'type' (such as cex, dex, dapp, games, etc.) and a 'subtype' (ex: contract_deployer, hot_wallet, token_contract, etc.) in order to help classify each address name into similar groups. Our labels are sourced from many different places, but can primarily be grouped into two categories: automatic and manual. Automatic labels are continuously labeled based on certain criteria, such as a known contract deploying another contract, behavior based algorithms for finding deposit wallets, and consistent data pulls of custom protocol APIs. Manual labels are done periodically to find addresses that cannot be found programmatically such as finding new protocol addresses, centralized exchange hot wallets, or trending addresses. Labels can also be added by our community by using our add-a-label tool (https://science.flipsidecrypto.xyz/add-a-label/) or on-chain with near (https://near.social/lord1.near/widget/Form) and are reviewed by our labels team. A label can be removed by our labels team if it is found to be incorrect or no longer relevant; this generally will only happen for mislabeled deposit wallets.",
    "ethereum.core.ez_balance_deltas": "This table contains the block level balance changes for both tokens (including ERC721s) and Native ETH on the Ethereum Blockchain for all wallets and contracts. If a token or Native ETH is moved, we will read the balance of the involved wallets at that block, and carry forward the previous balance into the current record. Symbol, name, and price are joined where possible. ERC721s are included. Data is currently read at the max daily block for wallets with activity. We plan to increase the granularity on this table to block level changes in the near term. Please note - the underlying data for this is large. If you want your query to run quickly, please use filters as much as possible. Using at least block_timestamp::date as a filter will lead to optimal query performance. Other filters will help query runtime.",
    "ethereum.core.ez_current_balances": "This table contains the current, non 0, balances for wallets on the Ethereum Blockchain. Symbol, name, and price are joined where possible. Prices are calculated as of the last activity date and as of the most recently recorded hourly price. ERC721s are included. Please note - the underlying data for this is large. If you want your query to run quickly, please use filters as much as possible. Using at least last_activity_block_timestamp::date as a filter will lead to optimal query performance.",
    "ethereum.core.ez_decoded_event_logs": "This model contains decoded event logs for contracts that we have an ABI for. Please note, this table does not include all event logs, only those that we have an ABI for. The decoded_log column is the easiest place to query decoded data. It is a JSON object, where the keys are the names of the event parameters, and the values are the values of the event parameters. You can select from this column using the following sample format, decoded_log:from::string or more generally, decoded_log:<event_param>::datatype. See below for a full sample query. The full_decoded_logs column contains the same information, as well as additional fields such as the datatype of the decoded data. You may need to laterally flatten this column to query the data. Sample query for USDC Transfer events: sql select tx_hash, block_number, contract_address, decoded_log:from::string as from_address, decoded_log:to::string as to_address, decoded_log:value::integer as value from ethereum.core.fact_decoded_event_logs where contract_address = lower('0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48') and block_number between 16400000 and 16405000 and event_name = 'Transfer' limit 50'",

    "ethereum.core.ez_native_transfers": "This table contains all native ETH transfers, including equivalent USD amounts. The origin addresses correspond to the to and from addresses from the fact_transactions table. The identifier and tx_hash columns relate this table back to fact_traces, which contains more details on the transfers.",
    "ethereum.core.ez_token_transfers": "This table will contain all events in the fact_token_transfers table, along with joined columns such as token price, symbol, and decimals where possible that allow for easier analysis of token transfer events.

    "ethereum.core.fact_contract_reads": "This table contains contract reads for a variety of functions and contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.",
    "ethereum.core.fact_decoded_event_logs": "This model contains decoded event logs for contracts that we have an ABI for. Please note, this table does not include all event logs, only those that we have an ABI for. This table will perform better than the core__ez_decoded_event_logs table, but does not include as many columns. The decoded_log column is the easiest place to query decoded data. It is a JSON object, where the keys are the names of the event parameters, and the values are the values of the event parameters.

    "ethereum.core.fact_event_logs": "This table contains flattened event logs from transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain. Transactions may have multiple events, which are denoted by the event index for a transaction hash. Therefore, this table is unique on the combination of transaction hash and event index. Please see fact_decoded_event_logs or ez_decoded_event_logs for the decoded event logs.",
    "ethereum.core.fact_token_balances": "This table contains the unadjusted token balances for users on the Ethereum blockchain.

You must also remove the 0x from your field to use the TO_NUMBER() function, if applicable.",
    "ethereum.core.fact_transactions": "This table contains transaction level data for the Ethereum Blockchain.

Liquidations occur when a borrower's health factor goes below 1 due to their collateral value not properly covering their loan/debt value. This might happen when the collateral decreases in value or the borrowed debt increases in value against each other. This collateral vs loan value ratio is shown in the health factor. In a liquidation, up to 50% of a borrower's debt is repaid and that value + liquidation fee is taken from the collateral available, so after a liquidation the amount liquidated from one's debt is repaid.",

For Blur's Blend, this could be depositing an NFT and taking out a loan or using the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) feature to take a loan out of the newly bought NFT. This NFT will remain locked until the loan is cleared.",
    "ethereum.nft.ez_lending_repayments": "This table contains repayment events for loans backed by collateralized NFTs on Ethereum. Events in this table can be a full repayment either by the borrower to get their collateral back or by a new lender to repay the borrower's previous loan. The latter is labeled as 'refinance' where the same borrower takes on a new loan from a new lender and repays the past loan. The NFT collateral is still locked in this scenario.",
